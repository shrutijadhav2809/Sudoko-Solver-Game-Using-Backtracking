# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm

This project demonstrates the **Backtracking Algorithm** through the classic Sudoku puzzle problem.  
It includes both a **Python-based solver** and an **Arduino setup** for visualization.

## 🧠 Overview
The algorithm fills empty cells in a 9×9 Sudoku grid recursively and backtracks when conflicts arise.

## 🚀 Features
- Python-based Sudoku solver
- Real-time visualization on Arduino (LED Matrix)
- Demonstrates recursion and constraint satisfaction
- Supports multiple puzzle inputs

## 🧩 Algorithm Steps
1. Find the first empty cell.
2. Try digits 1–9 sequentially.
3. Check row, column, and 3×3 box validity.
4. Place a valid number and proceed recursively.
5. Backtrack if no valid option exists.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Arduino
- C/C++ (for Arduino code)

## 📊 Performance
- Accuracy: 100% on valid Sudoku grids  
- Execution time: 0.5 – 2 seconds (Python)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- GUI-based Sudoku input
- Image recognition using OpenCV
- AI-based optimization
